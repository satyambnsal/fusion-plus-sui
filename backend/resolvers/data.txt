Fusion Plus Sui is an extension of the 1inch Fusion Plus protocol, enabling cross-chain swaps between the Ethereum and Sui blockchains and allows token exchanges across these networks using a relayer, resolver, and smart contracts deployed on the Sui testnet.


Fusion Plus Sui extends the 1inch Fusion Plus protocol to enable cross-chain token swaps between Ethereum and Sui blockchains. It leverages a relayer, resolvers, and smart contracts deployed on the Sui testnet and Ethereum Sepolia to facilitate token exchanges across these networks.
Key Components:
Sui Smart Contracts (Deployed on Sui Testnet):Token Contract: Manages the SILVER token (Package ID: 0xe33c8ada01d0c54b83546a768bf35b9af658502b59fa03c20793f832a91098d5). Supports minting via Sui CLI.
Swap Contract: Handles cross-chain swap operations, including escrow and order management (Package ID: 0x542196e996a3504bcfdc8b837d5af40c989c15dc2514357689bc76e619ef9a39).

Backend:
Relayer: Manages orders via REST and WebSocket APIs (e.g., /quoter/quote/receive, /relayer/createOrder). Uses LowDB for order storage.

Resolvers: P
process Ethereum-to-Sui and Sui-to-Ethereum swaps by subscribing to relayer events.

Frontend: A Next.js-based UI for user interaction, deployed at https://fusion-plus-sui.vercel.app/



Fusion Plus Sui is built primary with swap_contract written in move which allows users to deploy source escrow and destination escrow with configuration such as order deadline and safety deposit. it also allows resolvers to claim funds on behalf of user using order object id(in sui everything revolves around objects) and revealed secret key. we also use CrossChainOrder class from 1inch/cross-chain-sdk to create new orders. 
then there is modular structure of relayer and resolvers with resolvers listening to new order event on web socket from relayers.
